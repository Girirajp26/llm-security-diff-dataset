First steps\">    {i}This steps are only suggestions how to start a new game. After some time, you will probably find a better way which will suit your needs.{/i}\n1. When you start the game, whole map is empty and covered by fog. It is recommended to first thing to do in new game to ask for bases in base to which you are currently docked. Select {b}Ask for bases{/b} from list of available orders. If you closed this list, you can show it with key {Gamekey 14}.\n2. You may also ask for events in this same base. Each that \"asking\" action takes some game time but in exchange it gives you some reputation in the base. More information about reputation you can find in topic {u}4. Sky bases{/u}. It is always good to have high reputation in bases.\n3. At beginning the best way for earn some money is trading between bases of different types. Thus try to find two different bases near self and start trading between them. Some examples of good routes:\nThus if you find Agricultural base near Refinery, start travelling between them and transport Raw Meat from Agricultural to Refinery and in second way, Andrae Seeds from Refinery to Agricultural. Try not trade with Shipyard bases at beginning. They don't produce anything thus you may end with empty cargo travel. Trading between bases raise reputation in them too.\n8. Read other sections of this help, you can find a lot useful informations.\nDuring travel you may encounter various events. Some events may bring new options to orders (for example, attack on other ships) or take options away (for example, full docks in bases prevent docking to base). Most events exists by some time. Events on map are marked with mark {b}'?'{/b}. You may also ask for events in bases in which you are docked. You can ask in every base once on 7 game days. To ask, press {GameKey 14} key and then select option {b}'Ask for events'{/b}. Each ask take 30 minutes of game time. Amount of discovered events depends on current base size (in larger bases they know more other bases). From time to time, you can meet friendly ship which you can ask for events too.\nMore informations about trading you may find in {b}Trading{/b} help topic and about installing new ship modules in {b}Repair/upgrade ship{/b} topic.</entry>\n* Amount of informations about enemy ship depends on distance to it. In close range, you can see detailed informations about enemy ship modules. In any bigger range, only very general informations.\nHow fast crew member gains or lose morale depends on level of morale too: with higher level it gain and lose slower than when his/her morale is low. {fanaticism} members gains morale faster and lose it much slower.\nYou can ask for missions in bases where you have reputation level Unknown or above. Each base offers different missions - they amount depends on base size (in bigger bases you can get more missions) and on player reputation in that base (better reputation, more missions available). To see what missions are available in selected base, first you must dock to it then select option {b}Missions{/b} from {b}Orders{/b} menu (key {GameKey 14}). How many missions you can accept in base, depends on your reputation - with higher level, you can get more missions. You may reduce amount of money for reward for selected mission in exchange to earn more reputation in base. But one warning: if you fail that missions, you will lose more reputation either. To do this, move slider below mission info to the left. If you want more money but less reputation for mission, move slider to the right.",

Crafting: Setting crafting orders, discovering or buying new crafting recipes, some specific crafting tips.\n- 8. Repaiing/Upgrading ship: Self repairing and repairing in bases ship modules, upgrading ship modules, installing or removing ship modules.\n- 10. Missions: Starting and finishing missions, some detail information about each type of mission and specific mission tips.\n- 11. Hiring crew members: Detailed information about hiring new crew members in sky bases.\n- 12. Tips: General tips about playing the game.\nSome game modifications can add custom help topics as well. If it is your first time here, it is recommended to look at least {b}Ship movement{/b}, {b}Trading{/b}, {b}Combat{/b} and {b}Tips{/b} topics for basic information about the game.\nOn most screens you can find information about required crew positions in the top right corner. First icon is for pilot, second - engineer, third - gunner, forth - trader, fifth - repairs, sixth - upgrading ship module, seventh - cleaning the ship and eighth - manufacturing.\nFor pilots and engineers: If their icon is green, the position is taken by a crew member, and if it's red then you don't have anyone assigned to this position.\nFor gunners and manufacturing: a green icon mean all positions are taken (all guns, all crafting modules), a red icon means you have free positions (not all guns/crafting modules are taken), and a white icon means you don't have or don't need anyone assigned to this positions. For {sentient ships} a yellow icon mean that you don't have assigned anyone to that position, but you don't also require anyone either.\nFor repairs, upgrading ship modules, trader and cleaning ship, green means you have someone assigned to this position, red means you don't have anyone on that position but that you need someone, and white icon means you don't have anyone assigned to this position and you don't require anyone.</entry>\n<entry index=\"firststeps\" title=\" 2. First steps\">    {i}This steps are only suggestions about how to start a new game. After some time, you will probably find a better way which will suit your needs.{/i}\n1. When you first start the game, the entire map is empty and covered by fog. It is recommended that the first thing you do in a new game is to ask for bases at a sky base in which you are currently docked. Select {b}Ask for bases{/b} from list of available orders. If you closed this list, you can show it with key {Gamekey 14}.\n2. You may also ask for events in that same base. Each \"asking\" action takes some game time but in exchange it gives you some reputation for the base. More information about reputation can be found under the topic {u}4. Sky bases{/u}. It is always a good idea to have a high reputation in bases.\n3. At the beginning the best way to earn some money is trading between bases of different types. Thus try to find two different bases near you and start trading between them. Some examples of good routes:\nThus if you find Agricultural base near a Refinery, start travelling between them and transport Raw Meat from Agricultural to Refinery and or an alterntive is, Andrae Seeds from Refineries to Agricultural bases. Try not trade with Shipyard bases at the beginning as they don't produce anything and you may end with empty cargo travel. Trading between bases raises reputation in them as well.\n8. Read other sections of this help, you can find a lot useful information.\nDuring your travels you may encounter various events. Some events may give you new options regarding orders (attacking other ships) or take options away (full docks in bases prevent docking to base). Most events will happen given enough time. Events on the map are marked with mark {b}'?'{/b}. You may also ask for events in bases in which you are docked. You can ask in every base only once every 7 game days. To ask, press {GameKey 14} key and then select option {b}'Ask for events'{/b}. Each ask option uses 30 minutes of game time. Amount of discovered events depends on current base size (in larger bases they know more than other bases). From time to time, you can meet friendly ships in  which you can ask for events as well.\nMore information about trading you may find in {b}Trading{/b} help topic and about installing new ship modules in {b}Repair/upgrade ship{/b} topic.</entry>\n* Amount of information about enemy ship depends on distance to it. In close range, you can see detailed information about enemy ship modules. In any bigger range, only very general information.\nHow fast crew member gains or lose morale depends on level of morale too: With higher level it gain and lose slower than when his/her morale is low. {fanaticism} members gains morale faster and lose it much slower.\nYou can ask for missions in bases where you have reputation level Unknown or above. Each base offers different missions - they amount depends on base size (in bigger bases you can get more missions) and on player reputation in that base (better reputation, more missions available). To see what missions are available in selected base, first you must dock to it then select option {b}Missions{/b} from {b}Orders{/b} menu (key {GameKey 14}). How many missions you can accept in base, depends on your reputation - with higher level, you can get more missions. You may reduce amount of money for reward for selected mission in exchange to earn more reputation in base. But one warning: If you fail that missions, you will lose more reputation either. To do this, move slider below mission info to the left. If you want more money but less reputation for mission, move slider to the right."

Their morale is always the same. Their unique base is Barracks - a place where you can more cheaply recruit new crew members. Bases of this faction are much less common than Poleis. Gameplay is harder than Poleis due to fewer sky bases and the negative reputation of Undead with other factions.</description>\n<description>Group of connected together sky bases whose inhabitants are devoted to destroy all infidels around the world. Bases of this faction are much less common than Poleis. Their favorite melee weapons are two handed swords. They are know for their very high morale, they easily go into euphoria and almost never into despair. Their unique base type is Temple - a place where you can raise the morale of your crew by praying. Gameplay is much harder than Poleis due to fewer sky bases and the negative reputation of Inquisition with other factions.</description>"
