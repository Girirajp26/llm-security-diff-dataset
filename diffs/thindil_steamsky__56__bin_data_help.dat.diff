 Thus if you find Agricultural base near Refinery, start travelling between them and transport Raw Meat from Agricultural to Refinery and in second way, Andrae Seeds from Refinery to Agricultural. Try not trade with Shipyard bases at beginning. They don't produce anything thus you may end with empty cargo travel. Trading between bases raise reputation in them too.
     4. From start go to {i}ship info{/i} screen and set {i}Reduce fuel usage{/i} as a current ship upgrade. With time your ship will be use twice time less fuel for travel, which made it a lot cheaper and all other thing a lot more profitable.
     5. After finishing upgrading engine, upgrade ship hull size by one. Then find any {shipyard} base and install second engine. And of course, upgrade it that same like first. This allow you to not only travel faster, but also escape from stronger enemies or catch them faster in the battle.
