-    2. You may also ask for events in this same base. Each that "asking" action takes some game time but in exchange it gives you some reputation in the base. More information about reputation you can find in topic {u}4. Sky bases{/u}. It is always good to have high reputation in bases.

+    3. At the beginning the best way to earn some money is trading between bases of different types. Thus try to find two different bases near you and start trading between them. Some examples of good routes:
 * Food (rations, raw) from Agricultural bases to other bases.
 * Gunpowder from Industrial bases to other bases.
 * Wood from Refinery bases to other bases.
 * Ammunition from Military bases to other bases.
-Thus if you find Agricultural base near Refinery, start travelling between them and transport Raw Meat from Agricultural to Refinery and in second way, Andrae Seeds from Refinery to Agricultural. Try not trade with Shipyard bases at beginning. They don't produce anything thus you may end with empty cargo travel. Trading between bases raise reputation in them too.

Try not trade with Shipyard bases at the beginning as they don't produce anything and you may end with empty cargo travel. Trading between bases raises reputation in them as well.
     4. From start go to {i}ship info{/i} screen and set {i}Reduce fuel usage{/i} as a current ship upgrade. With time your ship will be use twice time less fuel for travel, which made it a lot cheaper and all other thing a lot more profitable.
     5. After finishing upgrading engine, upgrade ship hull size by one. Then find a shipyard base and install second engine. And of course, upgrade it that same like first. This allow you to not only travel faster, but also escape from stronger enemies or catch them faster in the battle.
     6. Select one base as a your home base (best is probably Agricultural if you need food and drinks to live, otherwise select Industrial), and start working on maximize reputation there. Best place for that main base should have one short trading route (one of described above) and shipyard base for buying upgrades to the ship.
     7. Sources of money are (from the best to the worst): Trading -> Missions (especially when selected only money as reward for them) -> Crafting -> Combat with boarding enemy ships -> Only ship combat.
